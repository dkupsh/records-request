To Whom it may concern,

Under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, 5 ILCS 140, I hereby request the following records:

{{body}}

I am requesting that you waive all applicable fees associated with this request as I believe this request is in the public interest and not for commercial use.  Release of this information is in the public interest because it will contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations and activities. If you deny this request for a fee waiver, please advise me in advance of the estimated charges associated with fulfilling this request. Please send me a detailed and itemized explanation of those charges.

In the interest of expediency, and to minimize the research and/or duplication burden on your staff, please send records electronically. If this is not possible, upon notification of such, I will provide a mailing address where requested materials may be sent. Additionally, please provide all records as they become available, rather than waiting to send them together.

If you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law. For each redaction, please provide the specific statutory exemption that you believe applies.

I look forward to hearing from you in writing within five working days, as required by the Act 5 ILCS 140(3).  Thank you for considering and responding to this request.
