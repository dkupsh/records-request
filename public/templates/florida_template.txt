To Whom it may concern,

Pursuant to Article I, section 24 of the Florida Constitution, and chapter 119, F.S., I hereby request the following records:

{{body}}

I am requesting that you waive all applicable fees associated with this request as I believe this request is in the public interest and not for commercial use.  Release of this information is in the public interest because it will contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations and activities. If you deny this request for a fee waiver, please advise me in advance of the estimated charges associated with fulfilling this request. Please send me a detailed and itemized explanation of those charges.

Please respond to this request in a reasonable time period. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.

In the interest of expediency, and to minimize the research and/or duplication burden on your staff, please send records electronically. If this is not possible, upon notification of such, I will provide a mailing address where requested materials may be sent. Additionally, please provide all records as they become available, rather than waiting to send them together.

Should you deny my request, or any part of the request, please state in writing the basis for the denial, including the exact statutory citation authorizing the denial as required by s. 119.07(1)(d), F.S.

Please contact me if you have any questions about my request.
