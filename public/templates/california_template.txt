To Whom it may concern,

Pursuant to the California Public Records Act (California Government Code ยง 6250 et seq.), I hereby request the following records:

{{body}}

Under the California Public Records Act ยง 6250 et seq. the government is allowed to charge only the cost of copying materials. I am requesting that you waive all applicable fees associated with this request as I believe this request is in the public interest and not for commercial use.  Release of this information is in the public interest because it will contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations and activities. If you deny this request for a fee waiver, please advise me in advance of the estimated charges associated with fulfilling this request. Please send me a detailed and itemized explanation of those charges. 

In the interest of expediency, and to minimize the research and/or duplication burden on your staff, please send records electronically if possible. If this is not possible, upon notification of such, I will provide a mailing address where requested materials may be sent. Additionally, please provide all records as they become available, rather than waiting to send them together.

Please contact me if you have any questions about my request. I look forward to receiving your response within 10 calendar days (as required by the California Government Code ยง 6253(c)).
